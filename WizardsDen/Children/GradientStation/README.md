## Miscellaneous Information

Gradient plans to completely diverge from Wizard's Den gameplay at some point, featuring persistence.

Gradient is/was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4

Originally, Gradient was planned to be truer to old SS13 gameplay, featuring tile movement and /tg/ sprites (before Wizard's Den switched to /tg/ sprites as well).

Gradient is arguably the oldest SS14 fork.
